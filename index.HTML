<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>WEB is a computer programming system created by Donald E.<br>
Knuth as the first implementation of what he called "literate programming"<br>
the idea that one could create software as works of literature, by embedding<br>
source code inside descriptive text, rather than the reverse, in an order that<br>
is convenient for exposition to human readers, rather than in the order demanded<br>
by the compiler.<br><img src="다운로드.jpg" width="50%"> </p><p>WEB consists of
two secondary programs: TANGLE, which produces compilable Pascal code from the<br>
source texts, and WEAVE, which produces nicely-formatted, printable<br>
documentation using TeX. CWEB is a version of WEB for the C programming<br>
language, while noweb is a separate literate programmin tool, which is inspired<br>
by WEB (as reflected in the name) and which is language agnostic. The most<br>
significant programs written in WEB are TeX and Metafont. Modern TeX<br>
distributions use another program Web2C to convert WEB source to C.</p>
